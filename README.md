How can the medical equipment manufacturers use the data regarding the number and distribution of patients in different countries in order to adapt their supply chains and transportation mechanisms? (Challenge from ALSTOM)
Medical equipment is key in dealing with the current situation. As there is a shortage of medical equipment, many manufacturers have dedicated  production lines to produce these equipment. However, this does not guarantee that the shortage issue is fairly answered across the globe (we have all heard some not nice news about medical aid not arriving at their final destination…) The use of AI could aid in determining the future number of patients in different countries and predict the number of required medical equipment. This data can be used by manufacturers to have an idea on how many equipment is needed. Afterwards, through transportation, the medical equipment could be sent to the target countries.This solution could ensure that every human’s life is treated equally. In addition, it can reduce the tension and stress on medical staff and allow them to concentrate on treating patients. Finally, by bringing different industries together, new business opportunities could be created. The challenge is then how can such a solution be realized? For this challenge the following specialists are required: 1. Medical staff 2. AI 3. Mathematic 4. Logistics 5. Transportation 6. Product design
